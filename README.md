# AirBnB Clone ― The ALX BnB
## Description of the project
The ALX B&B sums up the implementation of my four months of studies at the ALX-Holberton School - the fullstack software engineering program.
The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the [Airbnb Website](https://www.airbnb.com/) using my server. The final version of this project will have:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
- A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
- A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.
